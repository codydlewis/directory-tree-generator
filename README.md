# Directory tree generator

This project provides code to convert a directory tree structure (defined in a JSON file) into an actual directory tree at a defined location on your computer.

Some common use cases:

- **Project templates:** initialise your projects with pre-defined and customisable templates.
- **File organisation:** organise your digital files by hand-crafting your directory structure and have README files automatically created to help explaining the contents and purposes of each directory.
- **Reverse structure sharing:** convert an existing directory structure into a JSON file which can be edited and shared with others to replicate your structure.
